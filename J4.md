## J4 WORKSHEET 

#### Question 1.
Explain why the following class declaration is not possible in Java
**Because in Java you cannot inherit from multiple classes because Java uses a single inheritance model,**
**therefore, we can only have Lion extends Mammal or Lion extends Carnivore.**
**To accomplish inheritance we can do**
**`public class Lion extends Mammal implements Carnivore {`**
**`}`**
