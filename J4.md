## J4 WORKSHEET 

#### Question 1.
Explain why the class declaration is not possible in Java

**Because in Java you cannot inherit from multiple classes because Java uses a single inheritance model,**
**therefore, we can only have Lion extends Mammal or Lion extends Carnivore.**
**To accomplish inheritance we can do**

**`public class Lion extends Mammal implements Carnivore {`**

**`}`**

### Question 2. 
What are some of the functional differences between an abstract class and an interface?
**The abstract and interface keywords provide the user with the methods that their classs must declare**

**Abstract classes unlike interfaces provides methods, constructors and variables that a child class can**
**use inhereted from its parent class.**

## Question 3.
Using those methods in LinkedList complete the realization of a Stack and Queue:
**`public void push(int v) {`**
    **`addToFront(v);`**
**`}`**
